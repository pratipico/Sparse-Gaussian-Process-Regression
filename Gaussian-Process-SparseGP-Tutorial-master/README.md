This document is supposed to provide a tutorial-style introduction to Sparse Variational
Gaussian Processes which are typically able to analyse larger data sets than standard Gaussian
Processes. As with our other tutorials, the current document is accompanied by some
example Python code. The code is heavily commented and is designed to help those new
to the topic. It is recommended that this tutorial should only be studied once a basic
understanding of standard Gaussian Processes has been established. We offer such a tutorial
here: https://github.com/plgreenLIRU/Gaussian-Process-regression-tutorial.
