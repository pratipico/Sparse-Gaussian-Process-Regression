A tutorial-style introduction to Gaussian Process (GP) regression. 
It comes with some example Gaussian Process code, written in Python, that is free and should be relatively easy to use. 
The code is by no-means optimised, rather, it is supposed to be easy to read and easy to understand for someone who is new to GP regression.
